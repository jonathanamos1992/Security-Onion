# Security Onion overview (from text)

Security Onion is a free and open platformbuilt by defenders for defenders. It includes network visibility, host visibility, intrusion detection honeypots, log management, and case management.

### network visibility - signature based detection via Suricata
protocol metadata and file extraction - either Zeek or Suricata
full packet capture - Stenographer
file analysis - Strelka

### host visibility
we offer the Elastic Agent which provides data collection, live queries via osquery, and centralized management using Elastic Fleet. 
Intrusion detection honeypots based on OpenCanary can be added to your deployment for even
more enterprise visibility. All of these logs flow into Elasticsearch and we’ve built our own user interfaces for alerts, dashboards, threat hunting, case management, and grid management.


In the diagram below, we see Security Onion in a traditional enterprise network with a firewall, workstations, and servers. You can use Security Onion to monitor north/south traffic to detect an adversary entering an environment,establishing command-and-control (C2), or perhaps data exfiltration. You’ll probably also want to monitor east/west traffic to detect lateral movement. As more and more of our network traffic becomes encrypted, it’s important to fill inthose blind spots with additional visibility in the form of endpoint telemetry. Security Onion can consume logs from your servers and workstations so that you can then hunt across all of your network and host logs at the same time.

## Network Visibility

### Intrusion Detection

Security Onion generates NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) alerts by monitoring your network traffic and looking for specific fingerprints and identifiers that match known malicious, anomalous, or otherwise suspicious traffic
NIDS alerts are generated by Suricata.

### Network Metadata

Unlike signature-based intrusion detection that looks for specific needles in the haystack of data, network metadata provides you with logs of connections and standard protocols like DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, and SSL. This provides a real depth and visibility into the context of data and events on your network. Security Onion provides network metadata using your choice of either Zeek or Suricata.

### Full Packet Capture

Full packet capture is like a video camera for your network, but better because not only can it tell us who came andwent, but also exactly where they went and what they brought or took with them (exploit payloads, phishing emails, file exfiltration).
Full packet capture is recorded by Stenographer

### File Analysis

As Zeek and Suricata are monitoring your network traffic, they can extract files transferred across the network. Strelka can then analyze those files and provide additional metadata.

### Intrusion Detection Honeypot (IDH)

We also have an Intrusion Detection Honeypot node that allows you to build a node that mimics services. Connections to these services automatically generate alerts.

## Host Visibility

In addition to network visibility, Security Onion provides endpoint visibility via the Elastic Agent which provides data collection, live queries via osquery, and centralized management using Elastic Fleet.

For devices like firewalls and routers that don’t support the installation of agents, Security Onion can consume standard Syslog.

 ### Analysis Tools

### Workflow

## analysis tools work together to provide efficient and comprehensive analysis capabilities. For example, here’s one potential workflow:

• Go to the Alerts page and review any unacknowledged alerts.
• Review Dashboards for anything that looks suspicious.
• Once you’ve found something that you want to investigate, you might want to pivot to Hunt to expand your search
and look for additional logs relating to the source and destination IP addresses.
• If any of those alerts or logs look interesting, you might want to pivot to PCAP to review the full packet capture
for the entire stream.
• Depending on what you see in the stream, you might want to send it to CyberChef for further analysis and
decoding.
• Escalate alerts and logs to Cases and document any observables. Pivot to Hunt to cast a wider net for those
observables.
• Develop a play in Playbook that will automatically alert on observables moving forward and update your coverage
in ATT&CK Navigator.
• If you have the Elastic Agent deployed, then you might want to search for additional host logs or run live queries
against your endpoints using osquery.
• Finally, return to Cases and document the entire investigation and close the case.

### Conclusion

# Installation

We're go to create a new VM using the Linux family and Version of Oracle 9


### Note
Since we do not have a RAID array due to our RAID controller not being compatible with our hard drives, we ran into an issue of not having enoguh disk space when attempting to create Security Onion Manager
<img width="1129" height="690" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd02235a-6296-4c9e-bfcc-a98d02787187" />

At the moment we don't know if port groups Security Onion that is in Management Port Group can reach our Domain Controller Windows Server 2022 in Domain Services via Palo Alto. 

ChatGPT says in the meantime we can use our Palo Alto management interface (192.168.3.1) and change later.

### Since we're not 100% sure those paths are routable, we'll stick with default
8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

# Security Onion Essentials 2024 Course

<img width="1198" height="669" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f98c6e-7669-4317-ad6b-0ae7b967b67b" />

### Operating System - Oracle Linux
- RPM-based linux distribution
- RPM-based Linux distribution is a Linux OS that uses RPM packages (.rpm files) for installing, updating, and removing software.
- Software is managed with tools like:
dnf
yum
rpm
RPM = Red Hat Package Manager

### Infrastructure:
Most subsystems of Sec Onion are containerized and run under Docker
With organization and configuration of grid managed by Salt

Grid - A group of Security Onion nodes (manager, sensor, search, etc.) that work together as one unified system.

What the grid does:
Shares configuration
Distributes data and workloads
Lets all nodes operate under one management plane

Data moving around between components is handled by Elastic Agent, Logstash, and Redis
Elasticsearch - parse and stores data for later retrieval

InfluxDB - Produces, retains and visualizes operational data on your Security Onion enviornment to trach and alarm

This infrastucture layer exists to process Network and Host data, which is what's produced by next layer

### Network & Host Data:
Elastic Agent - Collects logs from endpoints and send them into Security Onion for Processing
Can include logs generated by the nodes in Security Onion grid or any endpoints we want telemetry from.

***
Telemetry - automatically collected data about activity and performance that systems send for monitoring and analysis.
Telemetry = systems reporting what they’re doing, metadata about behavior
Data is what was sent.
Metadata is how, when, where, and between whom it was sent.
***
OSQuery - Allow analysts to run SQL-style queries across all of the elastic agents to retrieve data in real time

Stenographer - full packet capture component that will record every single byte traversing the network segment that you're monitoring for later retrieval and analysis

Zeek - Generator of network metadata, including both netflow style connection records and more expansive logging for IT and OT network protocols.

IT (Information Technology)
Systems that handle data, computing, and communication.

OT (Operational Technology)
Systems that control or monitor physical processes.

Examples:

Industrial control systems (ICS)
PLCs
SCADA systems
Power grids, water treatment, manufacturing lines

Suricata - Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Checks network flows for traffic that matches singatures 
Also capable of packet capture and metadata generation

Network flow is a summary record of a communication session between two endpoints on a network.

Strelka - Runs Yara analysis rules against files extracted from Network traffic, alterting if something seems to be malicious in nature.

### Analyst Tools:

Alerts page - provides a queue of suspicious events for your analyst to triage and investigate

Cases - suspicious events can be recorded for future review.

Hunt and Dashboard tools - provide quick analysis capabilities for stacking and sorting ingested log data for investigations or threat hunting.

Detections - allow analysts to write new alerting rules for deployment to the grid, closing the loop and ensuring indicator discovered in the threat hunt will raise an alert in the future.

Cyberchef - flexbible tool for encoding/decoding and manipulating data

Elastic fleet interface for managing your elastic agent deployment 

Kibana - Builds more advanced visualizations and queries against collected data.

### Intro to analyst tools

Alerts - Intended to be a central hub for all the malicious events detected in your enviornment.

### 
We wanted to check to see if our sensor was placed correctly so we ran 'ip addr' to check

<img width="987" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a743ae26-2275-47e6-9e51-70ccaf1ba08b" />

## Breakdown

### lo (loopback)
Internal-only interface
Used by the OS to talk to itself
127.0.0.1
Not related to networking, sensors, or alerts
You can ignore this for Security Onion placement.
<img width="762" height="70" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee74130-1f74-4f4d-8f17-00376390ce03" />

### Management interface (for the sensor) ens34 (this one matters)
inet 192.168.100.99/24
This confirms management IP (for the sensor)

This is how the manager talks to the sensor
Used for: Web UI, Logs shipping, SSH
NOT used for traffic inspection
<img width="785" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/139175cc-5497-4c1b-ae7d-a1f7135e27f0" />

### Monitor interface ens35 (this is the key)
3: ens35: <BROADCAST,NOARP,PROMISC,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> ...

Important flags:

PROMISC → sees all traffic
NOARP → does not talk on the network
SLAVE → attached to a bond

MTU 9000 (jumbo frames, common for SPAN)

This interface sniffs traffic only.

<img width="944" height="51" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f9409e-67c1-4bf0-8174-873804f63056" />

Bond interface (logical grouping)
4: bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,PROMISC,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP> ...


### bond0

Logical interface that groups monitor NICs

MASTER means ens35 is attached to it

Suricata and Zeek listen on bond0, not ens35 directly

This is what actually feeds detections

This is normal and correct.

### Docker bridge/sobridge (internal only)
6: sobridge:
inet 172.17.1.1/24

Internal Docker networking

Used by Security Onion containers

Not real network traffic

Ignore for sensor placement
<img width="858" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/693e6498-a215-4d13-a73a-d98c433ac8fe" />


### docker0
inet 172.17.0.1/24

Default Docker bridge

Same purpose as above

Not monitored traffic

<img width="804" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce13793b-950f-47d3-a40b-c755c04f20b2" />

veth* interfaces (lots of them)
veth66e02830f3f2
veth156e4ab0df34
veth68472a0df36
...


### veth interfaces

Virtual Ethernet pairs
One side in Docker container
One side on the host
Each Security Onion service gets one
Normal to see many
Not something you configure

<img width="993" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722f63d2-6dbc-4d14-b9a2-52f707a9b59c" />

### For our lab we want to know if we'll be able to see traffic
<img width="977" height="928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd6e0ed3-3f0c-4eff-90f0-5180fd6c0e61" />

We're going to place our sensor to monitor traffic on our Palo Alto VM

<img width="1008" height="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb634e39-fa88-45dd-8a66-51fdad11668a" />

### We want to verify we see traffic

we ran 

'sudo tcpdump -i bond0 icmp' 

and from our Ubuntu host, we pinged the 192.168.120.23 but did not see any traffic on the listening interface of the Sensor

<img width="1856" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4cf68c0-5a4f-41e2-ac5f-9caa004f0610" />

ChatGPT tells us to add a dedicated "monitor" NIC to the Palo Alto

Step 1 — Add the monitor NIC to the Palo Alto VM

In ESXi:

Step 1:
Power off the Palo Alto VM
Edit settings
Add Network Adapter
Connect it to the SPAN/TAP port group
Do not assign it an IP later

(We ran out of NIC spaces in Palo Alto so we are going to remove Client-PG and consolidate Legacy Port group and Internal-pg

We'll have to remove the vm's in internal from the domain.

To remove from Domain

Step 1 (only step)

On FLARE VM, log in with a local administrator account (not a domain account).
Do not remove it from the domain yet.
Reply “logged in locally” and I’ll give the next single step.

(This is just to show how to login if the bottom left still shows the domain admin)
This forces Windows to use the local SAM, not AD.

On FLARE VM:

Settings → System → About
Click Rename this PC (advanced)
Click Change
Select Workgroup
Enter a name like:
LEGACY

When prompted, enter domain admin credentials
Reboot when asked

On the domain controller:

Open Active Directory Users and Computers
Delete the old computer object (CARNAGE)

Put FlareVM and Windows 10 on the legacy port group

<img width="401" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a9dce4-22f2-4abd-bcf8-e2cd6d554ed2" />

Join to domain

### Now we can remove the NIC for Internal from the Palo Alto VM and have 8 port groups

We updated our Palo Alto Zones and Interfaces

<img width="2114" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7be698-4697-4c2a-a63d-f12b4afb3075" />

NOw it's updated in the CLI
<img width="798" height="613" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/850a2dfb-a958-413a-9f3f-431bca6f6108" />

### Now we'll erify the Security Onion sensor is actually seeing any packets (locally)

On the Security Onion sensor, run exactly this:

'sudo tcpdump -i ens35 -nn'

we're getting something
<img width="1023" height="782" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f711c0b1-3187-4823-9e39-d3d2e564db97" />

### From our Ubuntu linux we attempted to ping th default gateway and could not
<img width="742" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a6b9f7c-e7fe-4703-9970-3ce2d7de80d5" />

Leading us to believe we misconfigured something when changing the Palo Alto configurations
When we ran 'ip neigh show' we see we cannot reach our default gateway

<img width="814" height="75" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7f485f-ef43-418e-8671-8d833322ad52" />

Solution:

Now we can ping

### Okay now we routing is correct, let's switch back to Security Onion

On the Security Onion sensor, run:

'sudo tcpdump -i ens35 icmp'

### Convert ethernet1/8 into a TAP interface (Step 1)
In Palo Alto GUI:

Network → Interfaces → Ethernet

Edit ethernet1/8

Change:

Interface Type → Tap
IP → none
Zone → none (or a dedicated TAP zone if required)

Notice Link State up

# Had to switch gameplans here. Our version of Palo Alto needs licensing to truly packet mirror.
# Instead we are going to install vCenter and hope for the best.
# But first we're going to back up ESXi

Step 1 — Enable SSH (confirmation step)
Host → Actions
Enable Secure Shell (SSH)

Step 2 — Connect to ESXi via SSH
From any machine that can reach the ESXi management IP (Windows, Linux, or a VM):

<img width="1120" height="618" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d5d484-c43a-47bd-8552-d6398c7b29f2" />

Step 3 — Back up the ESXi host configuration (supported method)
This backs up ESXi host config only (networking, users, settings).
It does not touch VMs or datastores.

3.2 Download the backup

From your browser on your PC:

Go to:

https://<ESXI_MANAGEMENT_IP>/downloads/

Download the file:

configBundle-<hostname>.tgz
Store it somewhere safe (this is your rollback safety net)

This file is what you would use if:
ESXi config gets corrupted
vCenter enrollment goes sideways
Networking breaks badly

Do this exactly:

Open a new browser tab

Go to:

https://192.168.3.7/ui

Log in as:

root

Do not close this tab

Then (same browser):

Open another tab

Paste this exact URL:
https://192.168.3.7/downloads/52b6d7d1-678c-6f0e-64d2-672f77806f94/configBundle-Olympus.lan.tgz
It should download immediately

<img width="376" height="143" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bd60e67-5f94-4bb2-b8ea-bc98ac76a7cb" />

### What still needs to be backed up

We still need VM-level backups:

Step 7 — Open the datastore and locate VM folders
Do only this:

In the ESXi Host Client, go to Storage
Click Datastore1 (or the datastore where your VMs live)
Click Browse

You should see one folder per VM (for all 16 VMs)

Step 8 — Back up VMs from the first datastore only

Do only this for now:

Stay in Storage → Datastore browser
Open the first datastore (the one with most VMs)
Pick ONE VM folder (start with a non-critical one)
Right-click the VM folder → Download
Wait for the download to fully complete on your desktop

Do not download multiple VMs at once.


# Scripting
So copying each *-flat-vmdk file would take hours so we asked ChatGPT to make us a script.
It created a script that will search the datastores and pull each file that ends in .vm and will pull the main files we want out.
.vmx
.vmxf
.nvram
.vmdk

We saved the script to our local desktop in a backup folder and gave the location to ChatGPT. 

We logged into WinSCP and got the fingerprint from the session to plug into our script so it can authenticate.

Here's what WinSCP looks like 
<img width="1068" height="676" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/414b04f9-b92c-426d-9bb9-3352d5875b7a" />

Pretty clear view into the files that we want.

The script took some tweaking but otherwise seems like it's working.
We can let this run in the background while we finish setting up vCenter.

Also make sure to turn off sleep mode temporarily


# vCenter

We've downloaded VMWare-VCSA-all.802
