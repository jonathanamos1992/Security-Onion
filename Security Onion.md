# Security Onion overview (from text)

Security Onion is a free and open platformbuilt by defenders for defenders. It includes network visibility, host visibility, intrusion detection honeypots, log management, and case management.

### network visibility - signature based detection via Suricata
protocol metadata and file extraction - either Zeek or Suricata
full packet capture - Stenographer
file analysis - Strelka

### host visibility
we offer the Elastic Agent which provides data collection, live queries via osquery, and centralized management using Elastic Fleet. 
Intrusion detection honeypots based on OpenCanary can be added to your deployment for even
more enterprise visibility. All of these logs flow into Elasticsearch and we’ve built our own user interfaces for alerts, dashboards, threat hunting, case management, and grid management.


In the diagram below, we see Security Onion in a traditional enterprise network with a firewall, workstations, and servers. You can use Security Onion to monitor north/south traffic to detect an adversary entering an environment,establishing command-and-control (C2), or perhaps data exfiltration. You’ll probably also want to monitor east/west traffic to detect lateral movement. As more and more of our network traffic becomes encrypted, it’s important to fill inthose blind spots with additional visibility in the form of endpoint telemetry. Security Onion can consume logs from your servers and workstations so that you can then hunt across all of your network and host logs at the same time.

## Network Visibility

### Intrusion Detection

Security Onion generates NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) alerts by monitoring your network traffic and looking for specific fingerprints and identifiers that match known malicious, anomalous, or otherwise suspicious traffic
NIDS alerts are generated by Suricata.

### Network Metadata

Unlike signature-based intrusion detection that looks for specific needles in the haystack of data, network metadata provides you with logs of connections and standard protocols like DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, and SSL. This provides a real depth and visibility into the context of data and events on your network. Security Onion provides network metadata using your choice of either Zeek or Suricata.

### Full Packet Capture

Full packet capture is like a video camera for your network, but better because not only can it tell us who came andwent, but also exactly where they went and what they brought or took with them (exploit payloads, phishing emails, file exfiltration).
Full packet capture is recorded by Stenographer

### File Analysis

As Zeek and Suricata are monitoring your network traffic, they can extract files transferred across the network. Strelka can then analyze those files and provide additional metadata.

### Intrusion Detection Honeypot (IDH)

We also have an Intrusion Detection Honeypot node that allows you to build a node that mimics services. Connections to these services automatically generate alerts.

## Host Visibility

In addition to network visibility, Security Onion provides endpoint visibility via the Elastic Agent which provides data collection, live queries via osquery, and centralized management using Elastic Fleet.

For devices like firewalls and routers that don’t support the installation of agents, Security Onion can consume standard Syslog.

 ### Analysis Tools

### Workflow

## analysis tools work together to provide efficient and comprehensive analysis capabilities. For example, here’s one potential workflow:

• Go to the Alerts page and review any unacknowledged alerts.
• Review Dashboards for anything that looks suspicious.
• Once you’ve found something that you want to investigate, you might want to pivot to Hunt to expand your search
and look for additional logs relating to the source and destination IP addresses.
• If any of those alerts or logs look interesting, you might want to pivot to PCAP to review the full packet capture
for the entire stream.
• Depending on what you see in the stream, you might want to send it to CyberChef for further analysis and
decoding.
• Escalate alerts and logs to Cases and document any observables. Pivot to Hunt to cast a wider net for those
observables.
• Develop a play in Playbook that will automatically alert on observables moving forward and update your coverage
in ATT&CK Navigator.
• If you have the Elastic Agent deployed, then you might want to search for additional host logs or run live queries
against your endpoints using osquery.
• Finally, return to Cases and document the entire investigation and close the case.

### Conclusion

# Installation

We're go to create a new VM using the Linux family and Version of Ubuntu linux

### Note
Since we do not have a RAID array due to our RAID controller not being compatible with our hard drives, we ran into an issue of not having enoguh disk space when attmepting to create Security Onion Manager

### Solution that ChatGPT gave us

The solution that lets you create the VM

Instruction 1:
Create the Security Onion Manager VM with a smaller system disk:

Size: 200–300 GB

Thin provisioned

This is just for the OS and apps.

Instruction 2:
After the VM is created:
Add additional virtual disks to that same VM

Put each one on a different datastore / physical disk

Example:

Disk 1: 300 GB (Datastore1)
Disk 2: 1.6 TB (Datastore2)
Disk 3: 1.6 TB (Datastore3)

Security Onion will later combine these inside the VM.

For now, we'll go with 1 TB Storage

We'll use Management-PG

Send it and power on machine

Had an issue with licensing and CPU's, limit was 8 so we dropped CPU's from 12 to 8
